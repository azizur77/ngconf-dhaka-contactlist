# Welcome to AngularConf Dhaka 2014

This is a demo application that will be flaunted in the first ever AngularJS conference, Dhaka, hosted by PHPXPERTS in UIU.

This is a simple contact list that includes many of the features of AngularJS. To run it, simply clone this repo, `cd` into it and in the command line, type:

```
bower install
```

And then:

```
npm start
```

If you don't have Node installed, and have Python installed instead, you can always do a

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

and then browse to `localhost:8000` and take from there.
